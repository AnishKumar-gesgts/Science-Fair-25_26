This project is a simulation of the result of having external hardware correction, used to detect energy losses in gates, to then correct during decoding. This simulation was done based on various error rates, primarily based on photonic quantum computer amplitude dampening/relaxation error rates as found on the internet, as information isn’t very public. We aimed to answer the question: To what extent do loss-aware, ancilla-based quantum decoders improve logical conditional fidelity by correcting random qubit state losses, like amplitude damping errors, compared to standard decoders, such as in photonic systems? By simulating this hardware’s presence and the relative logical conditional fidelity difference with and without, an average increase can be reported as a fairly accurate representation of what additional correction methods can do to improve fidelity in photonic quantum computers, which have high loss error rates.

This simulation was done in Qiskit Aer with a 3-qubit logical qubit used for parity, but minimizing computing time, and also to hopefully maintain a relatively accurate representation of a photonic computer’s starting fidelity from a majority vote decoder. 6 of these qubits were data qubits, used to track a control non-error 3-qubit logical qubit with a simulated error system. Another group of 3 ancilla qubits was used for post-error data screening + correction. By using an XOR gate through double CNOT gates to entangle the result of the control and error data qubits for ancillas representing error, then using them to apply exclusion. 

2 major types of error were considered, the first being a Kraus density matrix for an amplitude relaxation error for a low-energy environment. The second was another Kraus matrix for a detection error, modeled as producing some undetected error, simulated with 99% accuracy.
Metrics were calculated to compare relative accuracy against a standard majority vote decoder and an error-corrected exclusion-based majority vote. No solution weighting was done, just complete exclusion. An overall logical conditional fidelity increase was measured as 22.8%, simulated across 4 error rates for 10 trials of 2000 shots each. These increases were averaged to determine this value, disregarding 50% error due to reaching a critical loss probability in which there was no improvement.

The goal of this project was to show that there is a future in improving fidelity in photonic quantum computers due to the effects of being able to make it close to industry-grade quality. Because photonic quantum computers don’t require cooling and therefore don’t incur exorbitantly high costs from cryogenic cooling, it becomes imperative to pursue more efficient, low-cost, and therefore accessible quantum computers, eventually to be used not just for research in companies but also by other clients.
